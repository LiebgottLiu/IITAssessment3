			<h1 class="title">This is Project group 33</h1>
            <p class="intro">With the development of social telling, more and more new things are being developed and applied in our daily life, which also means that more homework pressure is placed on students. At the same time, parents also need to bear a lot of life pressure, which makes them do not have enough time to accompany their children. So our project is to develop an app or robot to help these parents who have no way to accompany their children. This robot will enter some basic knowledge in advance to answer the students' questions. And some other features</p>

					<h2>Step 1: Communicate with customers to determine what functions we need to achieve</h2>
					<p>We will spend a whole week in constant communication with users, customers and others to ensure that we understand what kind of functions need to be implemented and what kind of requests they put forward. And make the most basic R & D plan<br><b>Week 1</b></p>
				</div>
				<div class="col_1 col_right">
                    <h2>Step 2 : Conduct pre-research on the code.</h2>
					<p>When we have fully understood what kind of functions this program needs to be implemented, we can start to study the code in advance. This is a very effective means to help programmers quickly plan their job requirements<br><b>Week 2</b></p>

				<div class="col_1 col_right">
                    <h2>Step 4 : User test</h2>
					<p> After the programmers have completed the most basic code, we can start the User test phase. At this stage, we need to go to the street to find relevant users to test our program and continuously collect opinions. For the next stage<br><b>Week 5</b></p>

				<div class="col_1 col_right">
                    <h2>Step 6 : Closedness test</h2>
