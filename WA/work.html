            <p class="intro">The project idea we decided on was a chat bot designed for school children.
            The purpose of the chat bot is to function as a form of ‘home assistance’ for studying children. It would do this by answering basic questions students had on different homework assignments and course concepts. It would work through an app the student could install allowing them access to answers about general questions on topics at any time, even when the teacher is unreachable.
<br><br>
To build this app there are many stages we would have to go through, firstly the app would have to go through several design phases to ensure the app is well designed and easy to use. These phases are important, as chat bot systems can often be complex and difficult to use. As a result of this having clear and good UI helps incredibly to showcase how a program works and what it does.
<br><br>
                First, we must be clear that this will be a huge project. In the next period of time, we must do our best to ensure that this project is completed in time.
In the first week, we need to send our communication team to communicate with customers to ensure what kind of functions we are expected to be completed in our project. This must be a long process, because many times, customers often do not know exactly what they want. So this requires us to constantly guide our customers to ensure that they can finally understand what they expect to be achieved.
            <br><br>    
At the same time, we would have to understand how it is a student would be using this program. This includes concepts like what sort of questions would they need to ask, what information would they need to know, and how would they use the program. To find out these answers we can interview students and use paper model prototypes to see the actual way they would interact with the app. The benefits of these methods is they give us exact information on the processes of the app and the students, allowing us to build the program around these answers increasing the usability and benefits of the app.
<br><br>
In addition to this, the chat bot can be trained and designed around these answers as well. The chat bot would need to be designed to answer the questions the students have so knowing what sort of questions the student may have and how they may ask them would be vital to ensuring the app would function well. This is important as if the program cannot properly understand the students it will not be able to respond correctly. This would result in the students receiving nonsensical or incorrect responses.
<br><br>
It would also be important to know what the students would need answers to this may be difficult to answer fully as the course program would vary wildly. The difficulties can be over come through working with the teachers before hand to ensure all the classes information and work assignment is stored before hand. However, due to the amount of data that would have to be stored that may take a while to do meaning it would have to be set up for classes in advance.
<br><br>
Realistically it is not expected we will achieve much progress in this project due to multiple reasons. Firstly, natural language bots are difficult to program and require lots of programming knowledge we do not have to function. Secondly, it requires lots of data to function properly, such as a reading of how people would interact with it, and we would not have the systems in place to collect that much data. Thirdly, to function properly it would also require a lot of information on specific courses that are ran in schools which we would also not have access to.
<br><br>
As listed above these are all various ‘dead-ends’ we would face with the production of this project. There are many other project specific issues that may be faced. Firstly, how would an individual collect all the data for the specific
<br><br>
courses a school offers, the developers could ask a school for the contact information of their teachers, but if a lesson would change that would significantly impact the bot and the data it could output. You would have to know the lesson plan was concrete and the actual bits of homework would not change between developing the app and giving it to students.
<br><br>
Secondly, the app would have gather information for each school that uses it. Not every school would follow a course plan exactly the same, for example in how they approached topics and discussed them in classes. This is before taking into account that different schools may even be taking different types of schooling systems. For example, a school may either be teaching the VCE’s or IB or any other type of program. The different programs would have entirely different courses available and even with similar courses, there may be differences in what is covered between the programs. This would mean even more data would have to be collected to avoid giving incorrect or unrelated information to a student studying in a different program.
            
            Overall, this is a relatively stressful job, as mentioned earlier. After clarifying the customer's needs, we need to repeat the process of programming, testing, revising, retesting, and revising. During this period, we will continue to discover new and different improvements. This will greatly improve the usability and practicality of our program.
<br><br>
At the same time, I must emphasize that it is necessary to ensure that users participate in the development of our program throughout. Many times, users will come up with new suggestions for us from a completely new angle, and these suggestions are often the most easily overlooked by our programmers, but the most important.
