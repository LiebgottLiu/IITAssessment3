            <p class="intro"> With the development of social telling, more and more new things are being developed and applied in our daily life, which also means that more homework pressure is placed on students. At the same time, parents also need to bear a lot of life pressure, which makes them do not have enough time to accompany their children. So our project is to develop an app or robot to help these parents who have no way to accompany their children. This robot will enter some basic knowledge in advance to answer the students' questions. And some other features.</p>

					<h2>resolution.</h2>
					<p>After going through everyone’s individual project idea in assignment 1, we decided to go with Chaitanya Bhide’s idea of the chat bot which is used to assist students with understand homework. We picked this because we felt the idea was complex and interesting, if it were to function it would provide great help to the people who need it. As a result of this, we all had a passion and interest in the idea of the project.</p>

					<h2>developing.</h2>
					<p>In addition to this chat bots and other forms of ‘assistant AI’ technology, such as Google Home or Amazon Echo, are all becoming more popular and seeing wider use. These types of technology are more complex versions of what we are trying to achieve with this project. As a result of this, the project has a lot of relevancy to a lot of modern home technology, which made some members of our group more interested in pursuing it.</p>
