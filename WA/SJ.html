                   <p>If the project were to be taken further and more developed we would need to expand the team to include more defined roles. The different roles we would need to fill are: A lead or main developer, a UI or UX designer, a QA lead to test the program, and the project manager to oversee the overall project.</p>

                   <p>The lead developer would have to be the main force behind ensuring the project is created. They would have to have knowledge on NLU (Natural Language Understanding) bots and how to build them. This is because these types of bots are very important if you want to build a chat bot system that can understand what the user is typing and so it knows what to output.</p>

                   <p>A UI/UX designer would be very important to the team, this is because they would be instrumental in designing the product, in how it looks and how it is used. With a complex system like this, having a clean and easy to use and understand UI is very important so as not to cause confusion.</p>

                   <p>The QA (Quality Assurance) lead would be important to the development of the product, as they would be the person who tests the system. With a system as unpredictable as a ‘NLU’ bot, a lot of testing will have to be done to ensure the system understands what the user is saying and asking for. If the system doesn’t understand what the user is saying it will be inoperable so this system working well is very important</p>

                   <p>The project manager would be important to the team as they would ensure the project going on the right path. They would do this by ensuring everyone is doing the work they need to be doing at the right time, they would also understand the overall goal of the project and make sure the project is on the right track to accomplish these goals.</p>
