Although we have many features, we would like to include within the project in order to be realistic our scope of the program will be limited to building a chatbot only capable of using the maths assistance feature of the program. Though the English assistance feature was to be added it is rather ambitious and will not be able to be completed within the given time. Although all subjects would like to get integrated into the system with the option of speaking a tutor/teacher these features will not be part of the project deliverables. Our first project deliverable which will be designated one week will be to create a UI for the application to make sure it is user friendly and attractive to students. Our second deliverable will be to create a chatbot which is able to be accessed through the previously built UI and is able to respond to the user’s inputs. Our third and final deliverable will be to integrate a maths feature into the chatbot which is able to answer the user’s maths questions. Our limits to this project will be the fact that this project will not have the teacher/tutor live answer feature and it will not have the feature to answer question to the rest of the subjects such as English, history, science and geography.
