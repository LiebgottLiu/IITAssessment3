			<h1>This is Project group 33</h1>
            <p class="intro">With the development of social telling, more and more new things are being developed and applied in our daily life, which also means that more homework pressure is placed on students. At the same time, parents also need to bear a lot of life pressure, which makes them do not have enough time to accompany their children. So our project is to develop an app or robot to help these parents who have no way to accompany their children. This robot will enter some basic knowledge in advance to answer the students' questions. And some other features</p>

						<h1>What does it do? </h1>
                        
					</a>
                  <p>Our groups project idea is to build a homework chat bot which will assist year 7’s to year 12’s through their questions relating to homework 24/7. This project will assist students in completing their homework or only assist them in taking the right steps towards completing the set homework. This application/chat bot will be able to assist the students throughout the day and night even when their teachers are not able to respond allowing students the freedom to ask questions whenever necessary. This chat bot will also have a restriction feature which will lock the student’s phone for a certain time limit which would not allow them to get distracted by different applications on their phones. Currently, the start of art in Chatbots refer to 4 different types of chatbots. The first being a Natural Language Understanding Bot, a Contextual Conversation Bot, a Memory Bot and finally the self-learning bot. An NLU bot is one that can process what the user inputs and can respond according to the inputted answer. This differentiates it from things such as a click bot as with click bots the user can only interact with certain options and buttons. With an NLU bot once the developer has taught the bot to respond to “What are your prices” the bot will be able to recognize when a user asks, “Price for a certain object”.  A contextual conversation bot is a bot that can consider the users current input while also considering previous messages given by the user or bot. This improves the user experience as the bot will be able to use context from previous answers in order to covey information further. A memory bot is one that can memorize things about the user such as their name, age or gender. Thus it will be able to remember a particular user if they do return to the bot. Lastly the self-learning bot is an AI bot which is able to learn answers through users asking questions and the AI learning how to answer them. The future of chatbots are thought to be bots that will be able to assist users from customer service to be able to do online shopping and banking. An example of this is the use of a chatbot which is able to find certain restaurants and book/reserve a table if needed. It would also be able to help in the delivery and pick up of food. The development of our AI in chatbots will be able to make this happen in the future. Furthermore, in order to improve them companies would have to analyse and collect chat transcripts and make the chatbot AI more human like in order to make them more user friendly. The chatbot can also offer post-chat surveys in order to find out what is wrong with the bot or if it can be improved in another way. </p>

						<h1>What is the likely impact? </h1>
                        
					</a>
					<p>The potential impact of this development is to have a chat bot that is readily available to students who need it when teachers are not available to answer questions. This would enable to students to receive help 24/7 and also be able to talk to other professional teachers and professors without having to email/contact their teachers all the time. Currently students who are struggling with homework after school hours find it hard to contact teachers and get them to respond within a certain time frame. This chatbot will change this and make it so that if a student has a last minute question that he needs the answer to the chatbot will be able to respond and will be able to answer the question the student needs help to. The people that will be affected the most are students and teachers. Students as they will be able to receive the help they need, and teachers will be affected too as they can register to answer questions and in turn receive money for their services. I believe this application will be able to create jobs as it will open spaces for teachers/university students to tutor high school students. It will allow international students to earn money by tutoring if they cannot get a job. This chatbot may however replace tutors and in person tutoring as students will not have to go to separate buildings or tutors houses as they will be able to ask questions and access tutors online.

						<h1><br>How will this affect you? </h1>
                  
					</a>
					<p>
This might affect me as due to this I maybe able to get into the tutoring business as it will be very easy for me to tutor students. Additionally if I needed help with an assignment a day before the due date I could use this chatbot to help me answer the questions I am stuck on if the lecturer did not answer my emails or did not respond over the weekend. This may affect all my friends at university and school as it will allow them to get answers to the questions that they need help with it. It will also affect some of my family members as they are teachers and through this application, they will be able to earn a little extra money on the side if they needed. My friends who do not have jobs and excel at studying will also be able to make money on the side due to the tutoring aspect of the application. This would enable them to make money when they needed and let them get help when they need on last minute assignments. Furthermore, my family friends who are currently still studying in school and need help during exam periods will be able to speak to people other than their school teachers in order to receive help and boost their confidence towards the exams and learn while out of school.
