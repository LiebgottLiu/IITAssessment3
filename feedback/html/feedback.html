So, we are all work on different parts individually and combine all our work at the last day. Our group has started the assignment a bit late, but soon we start discussing the assignment details through the meeting function in the Microsoft Team and assign one job to each member. One of the biggest challenge that our group faced is that the coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have reached to Australia. It had a huge impact to our working environment. Our school has been closed for months due to the coronavirus so we can not go to school and seek help from our tutor face to face and also, we can’t discuss our work face to face and we can only use the meeting function in Microsoft Team or by text message to communicate with each other. <br><br>This has increased the difficulties of interact with our group members and make it harder to work on the assignment. Another big challenge that our group faced is that one of our group member has suddenly dropped this course and this messed up our plan. Our group has started the assignment late, this experience taught us that we should start working on the assignment early to make sure that we have enough time to work on the assignment and we should improve the interaction time between team members. And by working on this assignment, our group members learnt the importance of team work. While our group are working on this assignment, we faced a lot of challenges and problems. When our group members are struggling on the task, they would ask questions in the group chat and others will try to answer the questions and solve the problem together, this experience taught us that the collaboration skills with team members and team work are very important when doing group.</p>

But it may be because of the impact of the new crown virus, which has brought a lot of influence to our group discussions and other projects, but what surprised me is that my team members have perfectly overcome the impact it brought, and reached the perfect Our initial expectations. Through this group assignment, I learned how to become a manager better and give full play to each member's strengths. Teammate TOOLs part about the use of github, I think it is not a small help. It allows us to easily save the work we have and view the changes made by other members. All in all, this is a very good software.</p>

                                            <p class="tm-text">This group worked well as everyone was able to work together and commit their time and resources into finishing our assignment. Everyone was able to communicate each other’s problems and thus we were able to resolve them as everyone was able to work together efficiently. Our timing could have been improved as sometimes when meetings where to be planned some member s were not online and that was due to a mis match in suitable timings for everyone. We could have also started combining our work earlier to take off pressure towards the end. One thing I found surprising was although some of our members were not perfectly fluent in English, they were able to take the reigns when needed and able to lead the group towards completing our assignment on time. A thing I have learned about groups is that in order to achieve a task effectively and efficiently group members always need to be able to communicate to each other.  Our GitHub log would not be as reflective on our group’s effort as only a few of our team members worked on the html page and thus would not showcase our entire groups effort. </p>

Overall I think we all did our best and worked hard. I think our communication could generally have been improved, in ensuring that are quick responses, especially when there are changes that someone needed to make to their work, but generally this wasn’t too big an issue during our work. Another improvement to make is we started too late, this would have given us more time to work and allowed us to collaborate more.

What surprised me was having this insight into how other students may work and study due to how they choose to produce and tackle their assignments. I learnt three things; firstly how effective groups can work together to ensure good work is produced. Secondly, how groups work can allow other people to more easily critically read your assignment work and point errors and improvements. Thirdly, how important good and consistent communication is to producing high quality work.</p>

Communication within the team was always great which made it easier for me to fit in this group despite the fact that I joined late.
