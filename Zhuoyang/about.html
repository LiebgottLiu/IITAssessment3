            <p class="intro"> When people developing a program, the code is undoubtedly extremely important. But testing is undoubtedly more important. It includes not only the testing of the code, but also whether the code has completed the functions it should show, and whether these functions really meet the needs of users. Therefore, before the entire program is announced, we need to test the existing program.</p>

			<div class="columns clearfix">

					<h2>Coding Test.</h2>
					<p>Code is an integral part of a program. This means that any problems that appear in the code will be directly reflected in the program, which also means that any function that users can use is implemented by a piece of code. So testing the code is the top priority.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col_1 col_right">
					<h2>User Testing.</h2>
					<p>At the same time, if a tester want to turn this program into a program that everyone recognizes, the tester need to enable users to participate in the development of the program throughout and present their valuable opinions at various stages.</p>
