			<h1>This is Project group 33</h1>
            <p>With the development of social telling, more and more new things are being developed and applied in our daily life, which also means that more homework pressure is placed on students. At the same time, parents also need to bear a lot of life pressure, which makes them do not have enough time to accompany their children. So our project is to develop an app or robot to help these parents who have no way to accompany their children. This robot will enter some basic knowledge in advance to answer the students' questions. And some other features</p>

            <p><b>Overall, we did a good job in Assessment 2, successfully completed most of the work, and carefully searched for information and selected the most suitable group project after many discussions. But in other aspects we still need some enhancements. For example, some details have not been noticed in the editing of HTML. The initial IT Technology part did not have a very good meet the requirement. In the current Assessment3, we will make these parts more perfect. </p>
