                <p class="intro">Since our project is a program to help students answer questions, we need to obtain students' questions through different methods. For example, students can enter the questions they want to ask in the question box by typing, and the system will automatically analyze these questions and find the corresponding answers. And according to the age of the students who ask the question, choose the corresponding answer method to ensure that all students can get the answers they need</p>

                "The Text Area designed by dingding is the best and most comprehensive Text Area I have ever seen. 
                It not only allows users to enter different languages, but also has automatic recognition and fuzzy input functions, 
                which helps students enter them more effectively. The problem

                <p class="intro"> At the same time, research shows that students often erroneously explain their core problems when explaining more difficult topics, so we need to allow students to take pictures and upload all the problems they encounter, and then the background of the system will Upload to photos for image analysis to ensure that the system understands the real problems students face</p>

                The file scanning function will be a more important part of the entire program.
                When I was a kid, I often dreamed of growing up and developing a program that no longer requires people to type and enter. 
                If you encounter any problems, take a picture of the problem directly. 
                Photos, and then the program automatically scans these photos and analyzes them, and provides solutions

			<p class="intro">In summary, we need a large and efficient database to store the knowledge we need at present. In other words, we may need to enter these existing large databases to find the knowledge we need, for example: Wikipedia database.</p>

                but if I want to publish these programs, I need a strong database to back me up and help me. 
                At the moment, we do not have the capacity to build our own data, so the best way is to use the 
                existing databases to enrich our knowledge reserves through them
